# 🔐 Task-03: Password Strength Checker in Python

This is Task-03 of my Cybersecurity Internship at **Prodigy InfoTech**.

The goal of this project is to evaluate password strength using both **regex checks** and the **zxcvbn library**, while also simulating how weak passwords can be cracked using tools like **John the Ripper**.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Regex-based complexity checks (length, digits, symbols, etc.)
- Real-world strength score using `zxcvbn`
- Feedback and suggestions for improvement
- Simulation-ready output for password cracking with John the Ripper

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python
- zxcvbn (Dropbox)
- regex (Regular Expressions)


## 📌 How to Run

### 1. Install zxcvbn: pip install zxcvbn

bash
pip install zxcvbn

2. Run the tool:
bash
python3 password_checker.py

📸 Sample Output
=== Password Strength Checker ===
Enter a password to evaluate: Cyber@123

🔍 Regex Checks:
✅ Length (min 8)
✅ Uppercase
✅ Lowercase
✅ Digit
✅ Special Char
✅ Meets basic complexity rules.

🔐 zxcvbn Analysis:
🔢 Score: 3 (Strong)
⏳ Estimated time to crack: 2 hours
💡 Suggestions:
 - Add another word or two. Uncommon words are better.
